  year={1985},
  abstract={The equation that describes fragmentation kinetics, such as that which occurs in cluster breakup and polymer chain degradation (depolymerisation), is solved for models where the rate of breakup depends upon the size of the object breaking up. The resulting dynamic scaling behaviour is investigated. Both discrete and continuous models are considered.}
